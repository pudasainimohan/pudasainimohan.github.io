<p><strong>1.	Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Every day, customs officials battle an invisible enemy: millions of illicit goods hidden in everything from containers to teddy bears. Intuition alone can&rsquo;t keep pace with this evolving threat. Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI) - machine learning algorithms now analyze vast datasets, uncover hidden patterns, and pinpoint potential threats with uncanny accuracy. Imagine AI scanning containers in seconds, analyzing declarations, identifying anomalies, and prioritizing inspections - streamlining legitimate trade while tightening the net on illicit activities.</p>
<p>Customs administrations balance trade facilitation, revenue collection, and protecting national security and public health. This requires streamlining clearance, promoting compliance, preventing illicit movement of goods, and safeguarding public health while controlling fraud. However, globalization, technological advancements, and new threats like synthetic documents and trade-based money laundering have added complexity.
In this context, &ldquo;risk&rdquo; refers to the probability of an event hindering customs enforcement. Risk management defines a structured approach to identify, analyze, mitigate, and monitor potential risks in any customs activity. By embracing this proactive approach, customs strategically allocate resources. High-risk shipments, identified through meticulous analysis, are prioritized for in-depth inspection, while low-risk shipments are expedited, streamlining legitimate trade. Effective risk management empowers customs to enhance effectiveness and efficiency, bolster national security, combat revenue loss, and facilitate faster trade flows, ultimately ensuring the integrity and security of global supply chains.</p>
<p>Unleashing AI&rsquo;s transformative power in customs risk management holds immense promise. However, unlocking its full potential requires a meticulous strategy. The coming sections dissect the World Customs Organization&rsquo;s AI initiatives, analyze international best practices, and illuminate both the opportunities and challenges Nepal faces. Our ultimate goal? To forge a roadmap for integrating AI strategically, ensuring it empowers, not replaces, human expertise. This journey aims to empower Nepal&rsquo;s customs system to seamlessly identify and neutralize illicit activities, paving the way for smoother, more efficient flows of legitimate trade.</p>
<p><strong>2.	AI in Risk Management:</strong></p>
<p>Risk management is a fundamental pillar of every successful organization, and customs is no exception. It encompasses a comprehensive process involving all levels, from strategic planning to operational execution. Traditionally, this process consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining the context: Objectives, threats, vulnerabilities, and risk tolerance levels.</li>
<li>Gathering information and intelligence: Trade declarations, manifest data, intelligence reports, passenger information.</li>
<li>Risk assessment: Analyzing collected information to identify potential risks and their likelihood and impact.</li>
<li>Risk evaluation and prioritization: Assessing severity and prioritizing for action.</li>
<li>Risk treatment: Implementing appropriate mitigation measures like inspections, cargo profiling, or targeted audits.</li>
<li>Monitoring and review: Monitoring effectiveness and reviewing the overall process.</li>
<li>Documentation, communication, and consultation: Maintaining clear records and ensuring effective communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>While human expertise remains vital, AI excels in optimizing the operational level, particularly regarding data analysis and resource allocation.
How AI Assists Operational Risk Management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predictive risk assessment and targeting: AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of data, predicting risks like undervaluation, misclassification, and prohibited goods. This enables focusing inspections on high-risk shipments.</li>
<li>Automated document processing and verifications: AI systems rapidly process and verify documents, identifying inconsistencies and fraud indicators, freeing up officer time and improving clearance speed.</li>
<li>Trade pattern analysis: AI identifies unusual patterns, indicating potential smuggling attempts, allowing proactive prevention.</li>
<li>Image recognition and anomaly detection: AI-powered systems analyze baggages and containers, automatically identifying hidden compartments or contraband, enhancing detection capabilities.</li>
<li>HS classifications: AI assists in accurate HS code classification using Natural Language Processing and large language models, ensuring proper duty assessment and preventing misclassification-related fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these applications, AI offers groundbreaking advancements, from post-clearance audits to AI-powered supply chain analysis. Passenger clearance can be streamlined through risk-based profiling from Advance Passenger Information (API) and Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, and open-source intelligence gathering can shed light on emerging smuggling trends. However, acknowledging limitations in bias, explainability, and legal frameworks is crucial. While AI is unsuitable for solely dictating decisions, its potential as a powerful assistant for customs officers is undeniable. By responsibly navigating these challenges, we pave the way for a future where AI empowers human expertise to build a more secure and efficient global trade environment.</p>
<p><strong>3.	WCO Initiatives and Activities related to AI</strong></p>
<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes across industries, the World Customs Organization (WCO), an independent intergovernmental body serving 185 member countries, recognizes its immense potential to reshape customs operations. Moving beyond its core activities of rule-setting, international cooperation, and capacity building, the WCO actively fosters AI initiatives to empower its members in leveraging data analytics and intelligent technologies. Since 2019, the WCO has been implementing the BAnd of CUstoms Data Analytics (BACUDA) project to enhance data initiatives focusing on AI implementation.
Following are the key initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>WCO data strategy: Spearheading this movement is the WCO&rsquo;s data strategy, resting on three pillars: data sharing, building communities of practice, and providing assistance with the transition to data-driven practices. This strategy aims to create a future where customs operations are informed by reliable and shared data, fostering collaboration and innovation across borders.</li>
<li>Capacity building framework on data analytics: To equip its members with the necessary skills and knowledge, the WCO has established a comprehensive capacity building framework focused on data analytics. This framework promotes evidence-based policymaking, improved data management practices, and increased transparency and trust in customs decision-making. Ultimately, it aims to deliver services aligned with stakeholders&rsquo; needs, foster innovation and collaboration, and optimize resource utilization.</li>
<li>Algorithm Development: On the cutting edge of AI development, the WCO actively promotes the creation of AI algorithms tailored to customs challenges, such as the Dual Attentive Tree-aware Embedding for Customs Fraud Detection (DATE) and  AI-HS. These initiatives contribute to the BACUDA data analytics series, a flagship program showcasing the power of AI in tackling complex customs tasks.</li>

      <title> Navigating the &#34;Artificial Intelligence in Border Management&#34; Course</title>
      <link>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/talk/2023_uvic/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/talk/2023_uvic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Customs official at Nepal Customs with a specialization in risk management, my quest for knowledge and innovation led me to an enriching experience - the course titled &amp;ldquo;Artificial Intelligence in Border Management.&amp;rdquo; Offered by the University of Victoria (Canada) in partnership with Border in Globalization(BiG) Lab, this course promised to delve into the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications within the intricate landscape of border control and customs management. Over the span of four days, I was immersed in a world of insights, discussions, and hands-on learning that expanded my horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Laying the Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course commenced with a captivating session led by Thomas Cantens (World Customs organization), a brilliant mind who explored the historical and anthropological significance of customs and mathematics. This intriguing perspective shed light on how these seemingly unrelated fields have converged over time to play a pivotal role in border management. The subsequent sessions, steered by Peter Swartz(Co-founder, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://altana.ai/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://altana.ai/&lt;/a&gt;)  introduced us to the fundamental concepts of AI and machine learning (ML). We explored the basic definitions, mechanisms, and the potential they hold for revolutionizing border control. The day continued with an exploration of knowledge graphs, offering a glimpse into how intricate network representations of the world can be leveraged for modeling trade. The practical aspect of Day 1 allowed us to apply our nascent understanding to real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Targeting Illicit Activities with Precision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was dedicated to understanding how AI and ML can be employed to target various forms of illicit activities. Peter Swartz guided us through the intricacies of employing AI to combat smuggling – whether it&amp;rsquo;s narcotics, weapons, or counterfeits. The session expanded to AI&amp;rsquo;s role in targeting revenue evasion, a critical aspect of trade regulation. The most intriguing discussions revolved around using AI for trade facilitation while maintaining the enforcement of laws and regulations. The day&amp;rsquo;s practical exercises honed our ability to devise AI-driven strategies against illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Real-world Applications and Ethical Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rim Khazall from the Canada Services and Borders Agency shared invaluable insights into the real-world applications of AI. Reflecting on practical use cases added a layer of authenticity to our learning experience. The day further delved into the deployment of AI/ML systems, tackling critical issues of privacy and security. We also grappled with the ethical dimensions of AI, exploring the defensibility and explainability of the models we were learning to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Crafting Policies for the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the course neared its conclusion, Claude Beaupres guided us through the realm of policy making, emphasizing the importance of crafting well-informed policy papers and briefs. This session bridged the technical knowledge gained throughout the course with the practical application in the real world. The day concluded with a synthesis of our learning journey through practical exercises and the opportunity to compose a paper that encapsulated our insights and learnings from the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing the &amp;ldquo;Artificial Intelligence in Border Management&amp;rdquo; course has been an enlightening journey that has significantly enriched my perspective as a data science practitioner. This course went beyond the technical aspects of AI and delved deep into its transformative potential within the realm of border control. Not only did it equip me with a comprehensive understanding of the various AI technologies applicable in this context, but it also honed my ability to critically assess the ethical, security, and policy dimensions intrinsic to their deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

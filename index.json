Expedited clearance of environmental goods is a priority for many Customs administrations. The HS code system presents a challenge, as many green and non-green products share the same codes. Customs must maintain a balance between trade facilitation and compliance. AI presents promising tools for identifying environmental goods and detecting potential fraud. My research developed AI models capable of classifying goods based on their commercial descriptions and flagging suspicious patterns. In the absence of a universal definition, I used lists from three international agreements to train the models. The models demonstrated strong performance and offer practical relevance for Customs risk management.

Every year, the World Customs Organization (WCO) puts out its International Customs Day theme to underscore the most recent challenges and opportunities regarding customs. The WCO theme for 2025 is \u0026ldquo;Customs Delivering on its Commitment to Efficiency, Security, and Prosperity\u0026rdquo;. This theme indicates the commitment to the development and modernization of customs processes around the globe.\nNepal Customs has made notable progress in using digital tools and automation, with ASYCUDA World as the main system for declarations in major customs offices. Many modules support data-based operations, including risk-based targeting, creating risk profiles, forecasting trade and revenue, valuation, and providing trade statistics to the public. The launch of a National Single Window system has made trade easier by allowing regulatory bodies to issue licenses, permits, certificates, and other documents online. A notable development in the utilization of AI in the Nepal Customs is the application of AI driven Harmonic code search.\nAchieving effective risk management and data analytics has been one of the cornerstones of improving efficiency, transparency, and compliance in customs. The building blocks of big data and artificial intelligence and machine learning enables decision-making, risk assessment, and resource allocation within the Customs to be more effective. Data driven techniques help mitigate the unidentified and managed trends, patterns, and trade compliance risks. They also facilitate the targeting and profiling of different threats on the basis of risks. These improvements augment the effectiveness of transparency and accountability in customs.\nEven after these changes took place, Nepal Customs have some challenges during the process of a fully data rich environment.

For example, you can create a tuple that stores the names of the months like this:\n# Create a tuple\rmonths = (\u0026quot;January\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;February\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;March\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;April\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;May\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;June\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;July\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;August\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;September\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;October\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;November\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;December\u0026quot;)\rmonths\r('January',\r'February',\r'March',\r'April',\r'May',\r'June',\r'July',\r'August',\r'September',\r'October',\r'November',\r'December')\rYou can also create a tuple using the built-in tuple() function, which takes an iterable (such as a list or another tuple) and converts it into a tuple. For example:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\rmy_tuple = tuple(my_list)\rmy_tuple\r(1, 2, 3)\rIf you have a tuple containing the months of the year, you can use len() to find out how many months are in the tuple:\nlen(months)\r12\rOne of the benefits of tuples in Python is that they can contain elements of different types. For example, you can create a tuple that stores both integers and strings:\nmy_tuple = (1, \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot;, 3.14)\rmy_tuple\r(1, 'hello', 3.14)\rIndexing and slicing tuples is similar to indexing and slicing lists in Python. To access a single element of a tuple, you can use square brackets and the index of the element you want to access. In Python, indices start at 0, so the first element of a tuple has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on. For example:\nmonths[0]\r'January'\rmonths[::2]\r('January', 'March', 'May', 'July', 'September', 'November')\rBasic Tuple Methods Tuples have built-in methods, but not as many as lists do. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at two of them:\nYou can use the .index() method to find the index of a specific value in a tuple. If the value is found in the tuple, the method returns the index of the first occurrence of the value. If the value is not found, the method raises a ValueError\nmonths.index(\u0026quot;January\u0026quot;)\r0\rmonths.index(\u0026quot;Nepal\u0026quot;)\r---------------------------------------------------------------------------\rValueError Traceback (most recent call last)\rCell In[10], line 1\r----\u0026gt; 1 months.index(\u0026quot;Nepal\u0026quot;)\rValueError: tuple.index(x): x not in tuple\rYou can use the .count() method to count the number of times a specific value appears in a tuple. This method returns an integer that represents the number of occurrences of the value in the tuple. for example\nt=(1,2,3,4,2,1,2,4)\rt.count(2)\r3\rImmutability Tuple can\u0026rsquo;t be stressed enough thay are immutable. To drive that point home, let\u0026rsquo;s take an example and try to replace \u0026ldquo;january\u0026rdquo; by \u0026ldquo;Jan\u0026rdquo;\nmonths[0]= 'Jan'\r---------------------------------------------------------------------------\rTypeError Traceback (most recent call last)\rCell In[13], line 1\r----\u0026gt; 1 months[0]= 'Jan'\rTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\rBecause of this immutability, tuples can\u0026rsquo;t grow. Once a tuple is made we can not add to it.\nmonths.append('Baishakh')\r---------------------------------------------------------------------------\rAttributeError Traceback (most recent call last)\rCell In[14], line 1\r----\u0026gt; 1 months.append('Baishakh')\rAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'\rIn summary, Tuples are immutable data structures in Python, similar to lists but with key differences. They can be constructed using parentheses, and can contain multiple data types. Tuples support basic methods like indexing, slicing, counting, and returning the length of the tuple. The immutability of tuples makes them useful for representing constant values, while their compact size and faster processing speed make them a good choice for certain types of data.\n","date":1676592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676592000,"objectID":"8cd8d54655913ae255906aaf2909dda7","permalink":"https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/intro_tuple/","publishdate":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/intro_tuple/","section":"post","summary":"Tuples in Python, a data structure that is similar to lists but immutable.

Unlike sequences that store objects by their relative position, mappings use a unique key to store objects. This key-based approach makes Python dictionaries incredibly versatile and suitable for representing a wide range of real-world scenarios. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that since mappings are not defined by order, Python dictionaries won\u0026rsquo;t retain the order of objects. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll delve into the basics of Python dictionaries, including how to construct a dictionary, access objects within it, create nested dictionaries, and use some of the basic dictionary methods.\nConstructing a Dictionary In Python, you can construct a dictionary using a set of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. Each key-value pair is separated by a colon, and the pairs are separated by commas. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a simple dictionary\nfruit = {'apple': 2, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 5}\rIn this example, the keys are strings (\u0026lsquo;apple\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;banana\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;orange\u0026rsquo;) and the values are integers (2, 3, 5). You can access the values in the dictionary by using the keys as indices. For example, fruit[\u0026lsquo;apple\u0026rsquo;] would return the value 2.\nfruit['apple']\r2\rIts important to note that dictionaries are very flexible in the data types they can hold. For example:\nfruit = {'name': 'apple','color': 'red','vitamins': ['A', 'C']}\rhere Vitamin contains the list and to access the value associated with a particular key in a dictionary, you can use square bracket notation with the key inside the brackets. For example, to access the value associated with the \u0026lsquo;vitamins\u0026rsquo; key in the \u0026lsquo;fruit\u0026rsquo; dictionary, you can use the following code: fruit[\u0026lsquo;vitamins\u0026rsquo;]\nfruit['vitamins']\r['A', 'C']\rThis will return the value associated with the \u0026lsquo;vitamins\u0026rsquo; key, which in this case is the list [\u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo;].Once you have the list, you can perform various operations on it. For example, you can access individual elements in the list using their index, like this: fruit[\u0026lsquo;vitamins\u0026rsquo;][0]. This would return the string \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo;, which is the first item in the list.\nfruit['vitamins'][0]\r'A'\ryou can also call methods on that value, for example\nfruit['vitamins'][0].lower()\r'a'\rThis would return the string \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;, since the lower() method converts the string \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; to lowercase.\nyou can modifiy the element of the dictionary. for example\nfruit['vitamins'].append('B')\rfruit\r{'name': 'apple', 'color': 'red', 'vitamins': ['A', 'C', 'B']}\rhere, new element \u0026lsquo;B\u0026rsquo; to the vitamins has been added.\nWe can also create keys by assignment. For instance if we started off with an empty dictionary, we could continually add to it:\nCreate a new dictionary\rd = {}\rCreate a new key through assignment\rd['animal'] = 'Dog'\rCan do this with any object\rd['answer'] = 42\rd\r{'animal': 'Dog', 'answer': 42}\rNesting with Dictionaries By now, you might be realizing how flexible and powerful Python is, especially when it comes to nesting objects and calling methods on them. To further illustrate this, consider the following example of a dictionary nested inside another dictionary\nDictionary nested inside a dictionary nested inside a dictionary\rd = {'key1':{'nestkey':{'subnestkey':'value'}}}\rWow! That\u0026rsquo;s a quite the inception of dictionaries! Let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can grab that value:\nKeep calling the keys\rd['key1']['nestkey']['subnestkey']\r'value'\rA few Dictionary Methods There are a few methods we can call on a dictionary. Let\u0026rsquo;s get a quick introduction to a few of them:\nCreate a typical dictionary\rd = {'key1':1,'key2':2,'key3':3}\rMethod to return a list of all keys d.keys()\rdict_keys(['key1', 'key2', 'key3'])\rMethod to grab all values\rd.values()\rdict_values([1, 2, 3])\ritems() emthod return tuples of all items , we will discuss about tuple in next article.\nd.items()\rdict_items([('key1', 1), ('key2', 2), ('key3', 3)])\rIn summary, dictionaries in Python are a powerful and flexible data structure that allow you to store and organize data in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered collections of objects, where each object is identified by a unique key. They are mutable, which means you can modify their contents by adding, removing, or updating key-value pairs. Additionally, the keys in a dictionary are unique, which means you cannot have multiple entries with the same key.\n","date":1676419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676419200,"objectID":"f3f08c79c70aa56bc996b43d27f5a968","permalink":"https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/python_dictionary/","publishdate":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/python_dictionary/","section":"post","summary":"Python dictionaries are powerful and flexible data structures that store data in key-value pairs.

Lists are defined using square brackets [] and the items are separated by commas. For example:\nfruits = [\u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;banana\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cherry\u0026quot;]\rnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\rmy_list = ['Ram',23,100.232,'Book',True]\rJust like strings, the len() function will tell you how many items are in the sequence of the list.\nlen(my_list)\r5\rIndexing and Slicing Indexing and slicing are two important concepts in Python when it comes to working with lists.\nIndexing refers to accessing individual elements of a list. The elements of a list are stored in a specific order and can be retrieved using their index, which is an integer that starts from 0. For example, consider the following list\nmy_list = ['Ram',23,100.232,'Book',True]\rYou can access the first element of the list using the following syntax:\nmy_list[0]\r'Ram'\rSlicing, on the other hand, allows you to retrieve a portion of the list. The syntax for slicing is list[start:stop:step] , where start is the starting index (inclusive), stop is the ending index (exclusive), and step is the increment between elements.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of slicing a list:\nmy_list[1:]\r['Ram', 100.232, True]\rhere, The expression my_list[1:] is a slice of the list that starts from the index 1 and goes until the end of the list. In other words, it returns all the elements of the list except for the first one\nmy_list[::2]\r['Ram', 100.232, True]\rThe expression my_list[::2] is a slice of the list that starts from the first element (index 0) and goes until the end of the list, taking steps of 2. In other words, it returns every other element of the list, starting from the first one\nConcatinating list You can concatenate two or more lists using the + operator. The + operator creates a new list that is the combination of the elements from the original lists.\nmy_list + ['new item']\r['Ram', 23, 100.232, 'Book', True, 'new item']\rNote: This doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually change the original list!\nmy_list\r['Ram', 23, 100.232, 'Book', True]\rYou would have to reassign the list to make the change permanent.\nmy_list = my_list + ['new1']\rmy_list\r['Ram', 23, 100.232, 'Book', True, 'new1']\rThe * operator can be utilized for duplication, similar to strings,for example\nmy_list * 2\r['Ram',\r23,\r100.232,\r'Book',\rTrue,\r'add new item permanently',\r'Ram',\r23,\r100.232,\r'Book',\rTrue,\r'add new item permanently']\rBasic List Methods There are several built-in methods in Python that you can use to manipulate lists. Here are some of the most commonly used methods. append(element) - Adds an element to the end of the list\nmy_list = [1,2,3]\rmy_list.append(4)\rprint(list)\r[1, 2, 3, 4]\rinsert(index, element) - Inserts an element at a specific position in the list\nmy_list.insert(0,\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;)\rprint(my_list)\r['First', 1, 2, 3, 4]\rremove(element) - Removes the first occurrence of an element from the list.\nmy_list.remove(\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;)\rprint(list)\r[1, 2, 3, 4]\rpop(index) - Removes the element at a specific position in the list and returns it.\nmy_list.pop(0)\rprint(my_list)\r[2, 3, 4]\rsort() - Sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.\nmy_list.sort(reverse=True)\rprint(my_list)\r[4, 3, 2]\rreverse() - Reverses the order of the elements in the list\nmy_list.reverse()\rprint(my_list)\r[2, 3, 4]\rextend(list) - Adds the elements of one list to the end of another list.\nmy_list1 =[\u0026quot;Book\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Copy\u0026quot;]\rmy_list.append(my_list1)\rprint(my_list)\r[2, 3, 4, ['Book', 'Copy']]\rmy_list.extend(my_list1)\rprint(my_list)\r[2, 3, 4, ['Book', 'Copy'], 'Book', 'Copy']\rThe difference between extend() and append() is that the extend method modifies the original list my_list, adding the elements of my_list1 to the end of it. On the other hand, the append() methods creates a new list that contains the elements of both my_list and my_list1.\nNesting Lists The term \u0026ldquo;nesting lists\u0026rdquo; refers to creating a list that contains other lists as its elements. This can be useful when you want to group related items together\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how this works!\nLet's make three lists\rlst_1=[1,2,3]\rlst_2=[4,5,6]\rlst_3=[7,8,9]\rMake a list of lists to form a combined_list\rcombined_list = [lst_1,lst_2,lst_3]\rcombined_list\r[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\rWe can again use indexing to access elements, but now there are two levels for the index. The items in the combined_list object, and then the items inside that list!\naccess first item in combined_list object\rcombined_list[0]\r[1, 2, 3]\raccess first item of the first item in the combined_list object\rmatrix[0][0]\r1\r","date":1676246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676246400,"objectID":"baf83b5e3070dfef88c3a44fa58c620b","permalink":"https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/python_list/","publishdate":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/python_list/","section":"post","summary":"comprehensive overview of working with lists in Python, including concepts like defining lists, accessing elements through indexing and slicing, concatenating lists, using basic list methods like append, insert, remove, pop, sort, and more.","tags":["Python Basics","List","Data Science"],"title":"Working with Lists in Python","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mohan Kumar Pudasaini"],"categories":["Python"],"content":"String formatting is a technique used to combine an existing string with other values to create a new string. This process is important in many programming languages, including Python, as it enables developers to create dynamic strings that can change based on different inputs. In data science, string formatting is particularly useful as it allows data scientists to present results in a clear and readable format, streamline their workflows, and effectively communicate their findings. With string formatting, data scientists can process, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data with ease. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive overview of string formatting in Python and explore the various methods available to help you get started with this important technique.\nThere are three ways to perform string formatting.\nPlaceholder Method using % character .format() Method f-strings Method Formatting with placeholders In Python, there are several placeholders that can be utilized for string formatting purposes. These placeholders include %s, %r, and %d. lets\u0026rsquo; look some example of each placeholder:\nprint(\u0026quot;I'm going to insert %s into the code.\u0026quot; %'new text')\rI'm going to insert new text into the code.\rIn this example, The string \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to insert %s into the code.\u0026rdquo; serves as a template and includes a placeholder, represented by the %s. This placeholder indicates where a value should be inserted into the string.\nThe value that is inserted into the string is \u0026rsquo;new text\u0026rsquo;, which is specified after the % operator. When the code is executed, the output is the string \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to insert new text into the code.\u0026rdquo;, which shows how the value of \u0026rsquo;new text\u0026rsquo; has been incorporated into the template string.\nprint(\u0026quot;I'm going to insert %s information here, and %s data here.\u0026quot; %('critical','additional'))\rI'm going to insert critical information here, and additional data here.\rIn this example, the placeholders %s are used to dynamically insert the values \u0026lsquo;critical\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;additional\u0026rsquo; into the string. The % operator is followed by a tuple of values that are inserted into the corresponding placeholders in the string.\na, b = 'important', 'updated'\rprint(\u0026quot;I'm going to insert %s information here, and %s data here.\u0026quot; %(a,b))\rI'm going to insert important information here, and updated data here.\rhere, the variables a and b are assigned the values \u0026lsquo;important\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;updated\u0026rsquo; respectively. These variables are then used in the string formatting expression to insert the values into the corresponding placeholders in the string. This demonstrates that the values assigned to the variables can be changed easily, making the output dynamic and flexible.\nIt should be noted that two methods %s and %r convert any python object to a string using two separate methods: str() and repr(). We will learn more about these functions on upcomming posts, but you should note that %r and repr() deliver the string representation of the object, including quotation marks and any escape characters. for example:\nprint('My name is %s.' %'Mohan')\rprint('My name is %r.' %'Mohan')\rMy name is Mohan.\rMy name is 'Mohan'.\rIn this example, the string \u0026lsquo;Mohan\u0026rsquo; is being inserted into the sentence \u0026lsquo;My name is %s.\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;My name is %r.\u0026rsquo; using string formatting.\nThe %s placeholder is a placeholder for a string, and the % symbol followed by \u0026lsquo;Mohan\u0026rsquo; in parentheses is used to replace the %s placeholder with the string \u0026lsquo;Mohan\u0026rsquo;. similarly, The %r placeholder is a placeholder for a string representation of an object, which can be useful for debugging purposes. In this case, the string representation of the string \u0026lsquo;Mohan\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;Mohan\u0026rsquo;, so the %r placeholder is replaced with \u0026lsquo;Mohan\u0026rsquo;. let\u0026rsquo;s look another example of %r and %s\nwords = 'catch\\nand\\nrelease'\rprint('Remember to %s.' % ('catch\\nand\\nrelease'))\rprint('Remember to %r.' % ('catch\\nand\\nrelease'))\rRemember to catch\rand\rrelease.\rRemember to 'catch\\nand\\nrelease'.\rhere, first line\u0026rsquo;s result comes in three lines and the second line\u0026rsquo;s result comes in one line is due to the difference between %s and %r.\n%s is used to insert a string representation of an object into a string, which means that any newline characters (\\n) in the string representation will be displayed as separate lines in the output.\nOn the other hand, %r is used to insert a raw, string representation of an object into a string, which includes any escape sequences such as newline characters.\nThe %s operator converts whatever it sees into a string, including integers and floats. The %d operator converts numbers to integers first, without rounding. Note the difference below:\nprint('I wrote %s programs today.' %3.75)\rprint('I wrote %d programs today.' %3.75) I wrote 3.75 programs today.\rI wrote 3 programs today.\rPadding and Precision of Floating Point Numbers In Python, you can control the display of floating-point numbers by using the % operator in combination with placeholder specifications. These placeholder specifications allow you to specify the number of decimal places to display, as well as the width of the output field. To control the precision of floating-point numbers, you can use the . character followed by the number of decimal places you want to display\nprint('Floating point numbers: %5.2f' %(13.144))\rFloating point numbers: 13.14\rFloating point numbers use the format %5.2f. Here, 5 would be the minimum number of characters the string should contain; these may be padded with whitespace if the entire number does not have this many digits. Next to this, .2f stands for two digits to show past the decimal point.\nprint('Floating point numbers: %.0f' %(1300.144))\rFloating point numbers: 1300\rFormatting with the .format() method A better way to format objects into your strings for print statements is with the string .format() method. The syntax is:\n'String here {} then also {}'.format('something1','something2')\rFor example:\nprint('This is a string with an {}'.format('insert'))\rThis is a string with an insert\rThe .format() method has several advantages over the %s placeholder method: 1. Inserted objects can be called by index position: print('The {2} {1} {0}'.format('fox','brown','quick'))\rThe quick brown fox\r2. Inserted objects can be assigned keywords: print('First Object: {a}, Second Object: {b}, Third Object: {c}'.format(a=1,b='Two',c=12.3))\rFirst Object: 1, Second Object: Two, Third Object: 12.3\r3. Inserted objects can be reused, avoiding duplication: print('I %s you more every day, and my %s for you will never fade.' %('love','love'))\r#Vs\rprint('I {w} you more every day, and my {w} for you will never fade.'.format(w='love'))\rI love you more every day, and my love for you will never fade.\rI love you more every day, and my love for you will never fade.\rAlignment, padding and precision with .format() Within the curly braces you can assign field lengths, left/right alignments, rounding parameters and more\nprint('{0:8} | {1:9}'.format('Fruit', 'Quantity'))\rprint('{0:8} | {1:20}'.format('Apples', 3.))\rprint('{0:8} | {1:9}'.format('Oranges', 10))\rFruit | Quantity Apples | 3.0\rOranges | 10\rBy default, .format() aligns text to the left, numbers to the right. You can pass an optional \u0026lt;,^, or \u0026gt; to set a left, center or right alignment:\nprint('{0:\u0026lt;8} | {1:^8} | {2:\u0026gt;8}'.format('Left','Center','Right'))\rprint('{0:\u0026lt;8} | {1:^8} | {2:\u0026gt;8}'.format(11,22,33))\rLeft | Center | Right\r11 | 22 | 33\rYou can precede the aligment operator with a padding character\nprint('{0:=\u0026lt;8} | {1:-^8} | {2:.\u0026gt;8}'.format('Left','Center','Right'))\rprint('{0:=\u0026lt;8} | {1:-^8} | {2:.\u0026gt;8}'.format(11,22,33))\rLeft==== | -Center- | ...Right\r11====== | ---22--- | ......33\rField widths and float precision are handled in a way similar to placeholders. The following two print statements are equivalent:\nprint('This is my ten-character, two-decimal number:%10.2f' %13.579)\rprint('This is my ten-character, two-decimal number:{0:10.2f}'.format(13.579))\rThis is my ten-character, two-decimal number: 13.58\rThis is my ten-character, two-decimal number: 13.58\rNote that there are 5 spaces following the colon, and 5 characters taken up by 13.58, for a total of ten characters.\nFormatted String Literals (f-strings) Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings offer several benefits over the older .format() string method described above. For one, you can bring outside variables immediately into to the string rather than pass them as arguments through .format(var).\nname = 'Fred'\rprint(f\u0026quot;He said his name is {name}.\u0026quot;)\rHe said his name is Fred.\rPass !r to get the string representation:\nprint(f\u0026quot;He said his name is {name!r}\u0026quot;)\rHe said his name is 'Fred'\rFloat formatting follows \u0026quot;result: {value:{width}.{precision}}\u0026quot; Where with the .format() method you might see {value:10.4f}, with f-strings this can become {value:{10}.{6}}\nnum = 23.45678\rprint(\u0026quot;My 10 character, four decimal number is:{0:10.4f}\u0026quot;.format(num))\rprint(f\u0026quot;My 10 character, four decimal number is:{num:{10}.{3}}\u0026quot;)\rMy 10 character, four decimal number is: 23.4568\rMy 10 character, four decimal number is: 23.5\rNote that with f-strings, precision refers to the total number of digits, not just those following the decimal. This fits more closely with scientific notation and statistical analysis. Unfortunately, f-strings do not pad to the right of the decimal, even if precision allows it:\nnum = 23.45\rprint(\u0026quot;My 10 character, four decimal number is:{0:10.4f}\u0026quot;.format(num))\rprint(f\u0026quot;My 10 character, four decimal number is:{num:{10}.{6}}\u0026quot;)\rMy 10 character, four decimal number is: 23.4500\rMy 10 character, four decimal number is: 23.45\rIf this becomes important, you can always use .format() method syntax inside an f-string:\nnum = 23.45\rprint(\u0026quot;My 10 character, four decimal number is:{0:10.4f}\u0026quot;.format(num))\rprint(f\u0026quot;My 10 character, four decimal number is:{num:10.4f}\u0026quot;)\rMy 10 character, four decimal number is: 23.4500\rMy 10 character, four decimal number is: 23.4500\r","date":1676160000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676160000,"objectID":"605229bdd8e5122c285c37f1b696b734","permalink":"https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/string_formating/","publishdate":"2023-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/string_formating/","section":"post","summary":"Comprehensive overview of the three methods for string formatting in Python - Placeholder Method using % character, .format() Method, and f-strings.

Strings are viewed as a series of characters, each with a unique position or index in the sequence. This allows us to easily access individual characters within a string using indexing.\nFor instance, the string \u0026ldquo;Nepal\u0026rdquo; is considered a sequence of five letters (\u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;e\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;p\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;l\u0026rsquo;) arranged in a specific order. With the help of indexing, we can extract individual letters from the string, such as the first letter \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo; or the last letter \u0026rsquo;l\u0026rsquo;. This property of strings as sequences in Python makes them extremely versatile and useful for a variety of applications, including text processing and manipulation.\nIn this article, we will explore the creation, indexing, formatting, and various properties of strings in Python.\nCreating a String To create a string in Python you need to use either single quotes or double quotes. For example:\n'Nepal'\r'Nepal'\rWe can also use double quote\r\u0026quot;Buddha was born in Nepal\u0026quot;\r'Buddha was born in Nepal'\r' I'm passionate about data science'\rFile \u0026quot;\u0026lt;ipython-input-4-da9a34b3dc31\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 2\r' I'm passionate about data science'\r^\rSyntaxError: invalid syntax\r** error?**\nThe reason for the error above is because the single quote in I\u0026rsquo;m stopped the string. You can use combinations of double and single quotes to get the complete statement or use backslash(\\).\n\u0026quot;I'm passionate about data science\u0026quot;\r'I\\'m passionate about data science'\r'I'm passionate about data science'\rPrinting a String The example above only displays one output despite having two lines of input. Is your assumption that it\u0026rsquo;s due to the identical sentences ? It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that simply entering a string in a Jupyter notebook cell will result in automatic output, but to display multiple strings properly, the print function should be utilized. to show both line we can do as follow\nprint(\u0026quot;I'm passionate about data science\u0026quot;)\rprint('I\\'m passionate about data science')\rI'm passionate about data science\rI'm passionate about data science\rWe can use a print statement to print a string. here are some examples and their outputs:\nprint('Hello World 1')\rprint('Hello World 2')\rprint('Use \\n to print a new line')\rprint('\\n')\rprint('See what I mean?')\rHello World 1\rHello World 2\rUse to print a new line\rSee what I mean?\rString length In Python, you can find the length of a string using the len function. The len function returns the number of characters in a string. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nlen('Hello World')\r11\rString Indexing string indexing is a process of accessing individual characters in a string using an index. The index of a character in a string starts from 0, and the last character in a string has an index of len(string) - 1. You can access a character at a specific index in a string using square brackets []. Let\u0026rsquo;s learn how this works.\nAssign s as string and print it\rs = 'Hello World'\rPrint(s)\r'Hello World'\rShow first element (in this case a letter)\rs[0]\r'H'\rs[1]\r'e'\rWe can use a : to perform slicing which grabs everything up to a designated point. For example:\ns[1:]\r'ello World'\rhere, [1:] is a slice of the string that starts from the second character (index 1) and goes to the end of the string.\ns[:3]\r'Hel'\rIn this case, we tell Python to extract the characters from the first position (index 0) until the fourth position (index 3), but not including the character at the fourth position. This concept of \u0026ldquo;up to but not including\u0026rdquo; is a common occurrence in Python, and can be seen frequently in various statements and contexts. We can also use negative indexing to go backwards.\ns[-1]\r'd'\rWe can extract elements from a sequence by using index and slice notation, where the step size can be specified. To do so, we can use two colons followed by a number that represents the frequency of extraction. For example, to retrieve all elements with a step size of 2, we can use the following syntax.\ns[::2]\r'HloWrd'\rSimilary, We can use this to print a string backwards too\ns[::-1]\r'dlroW olleH'\rString Properties It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that strings have an important property known as immutability. This means that once a string is created, the elements within it can not be changed or replaced. For example:\ns\r'Hello World'\rLet\u0026rsquo;s try to change the first letter to \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo;\ns[0] = 'x'\r---------------------------------------------------------------------------\rTypeError Traceback (most recent call last)\r\u0026lt;ipython-input-26-976942677f11\u0026gt; in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;()\r1 # Let's try to change the first letter to 'x'\r----\u0026gt; 2 s[0] = 'x'\rTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\rNotice how the error tells us directly what we can\u0026rsquo;t do, change the item assignment!\nSomething we can do is concatenate strings!\ns= s + ' concatenate me!'\rprint(s)\r'Hello World concatenate me!'\rwe can use the multiplication operator to achieve repetition of elements.\nletter = 'z'\rletter*10\r'zzzzzzzzzz'\rBasic Built-in String methods Python objects often have pre-defined methods that come as part of the object. These methods, which are essentially functions within the object, can perform various operations on the object itself. To access these methods, we use the dot notation, followed by the method name. The general syntax for using methods is as follows:\nobject.method(arguments)\nWhere the arguments are optional parameters that can be passed to the method. If some parts of this explanation are not clear at this moment, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we will delve into it further when we start creating our own objects and functions.\nBelow are a few examples of built-in methods for strings:\ns\r'Hello World concatenate me!'\rTo change to uppercase:\ns.upper()\r'HELLO WORLD CONCATENATE ME!'\rTo change to lowercase:\ns.lower()\r'hello world concatenate me!'\rSplit a string by blank space (this is the default):\ns.split()\r['Hello', 'World', 'concatenate', 'me!']\rSplit by a specific element (doesn\u0026rsquo;t include the element that was split on)\ns.split('W')\r['Hello ', 'orld concatenate me!']\rThere are many more methods than the ones covered here. we will cover it on future posts\nPrint Formatting We can use the .format() method to add formatted objects to printed string statements.\nThe easiest way to show this is through an example:\n'Insert another string with curly brackets: {}'.format('The inserted string')\r'Insert another string with curly brackets: The inserted string'\rWe will discuss other options for print formatting in future articles.\n","date":1676073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676073600,"objectID":"04a1e8507fee6b6fc81d3361118d0d40","permalink":"https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/string_basic/","publishdate":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/string_basic/","section":"post","summary":" Basics of strings in Python, including how to create strings, use indexing and slicing to access individual characters, and understand the immutability property of strings","tags":["Python Basics","String","Data Science"],"title":"An Introduction to Strings in Python","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mohan Kumar Pudasaini"],"categories":["Python"],"content":"Python offers a range of numeric data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. In this article, our main focus will be on integers and floating-point numbers. Integers are whole numbers that can be either positive or negative, for instance 7 or -10. Floating-point numbers, on the other hand, have decimal components or use exponential (e) notation, such as 2.0, -2.1, or 4e2.\nHere is a table of the two main types we will spend most of our time working with some examples:\nExamples Number \"Type\"\r1,2,-5,1000\rIntegers 1.2,-0.5,2e2,3E2 Floating-point numbers Now let\u0026rsquo;s start with some basic arithmetic.\nBasic Arithmetic Python provides several built-in arithmetic operators for basic calculations, including: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo division (%). Additionally, it provides the exponentiation operator (**) which computes the power of a number and the floor division operator (//) which returns the integer quotient of division. Here are some examples of each of these operators:\nAddition\r7+4\r11\rSubtraction\r7-4\r3\rMultiplication\r7*4\r28\rDivision\r7/4\r1.75\rFloor Division:\r7//4\rUnexpected result from 7 divided by 4 equals 1, not 1.75. This is because of the use of floor division (// operator). It returns the integer result by truncating the decimal.\nWhat if we just need the remainder?\n7%4\r3\r4 goes into 7 once, with a remainder of 3. The % operator returns the remainder after division. let\u0026rsquo;s continue with some other operators.\nExponential\r2**3\rThe expression 2**3 in Python calculates 2 raised to the power of 3, which equals 8. The ** operator is used for exponentiation in Python. similary we can use power 0.05 to calculate the square root.\n4**0.5\r2.0\rVariable Assignments With a basic understanding of numbers in Python, let\u0026rsquo;s move on to assigning labels to values through the use of variables. To create a variable, you simply use a single equals sign (=) followed by the value you want to assign. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore a few examples to illustrate this process.\na = 10\rWe have created an object with a value of 10. If we reference the object, designated as a, within our Python script, Python will recognize it as the number 10\na+a\r20\rWhat happens on reassignment? Will Python let us write it over?\na = 15\rlet\u0026rsquo;s check\na\r15\rPython lets you reassign variables with a reference to the same object.\na=a+15\ra\r30\rThere\u0026rsquo;s actually a shortcut for this. Python lets you add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers with reassignment using +=, -=, *=, and /=.\na += 15\ra\r45\rYes! Python allows you to write over assigned variable names. We can also use the variables themselves when doing the reassignment.\nWhen creating variables or objects in Python, certain guidelines must be followed to ensure their names are valid. This includes:\nStarting the name with a letter, not a number. Utilizing underscores(_) instead of spaces. Avoiding special characters like \u0026lsquo;\u0026rsquo;, \u0026ldquo;, \u0026lt;, \u0026gt;, /, ?, |, , (, ), !, @, #, $, %, ^, \u0026amp;, *, ~, -, and +. Keeping names in lowercase, as recommended by PEP8. Steering clear of single letter names such as l, O, and I which can be easily misconstrued. Refraining from using words that hold special meaning in Python, for instance, \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;str\u0026rdquo;. Assigning values to variables in Python can greatly aid in organizing and tracking the data in your code. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example\nmy_salary = 50000\rtax_rate = 0.13\rtotal_tax = my_income*tax_rate\rBy accessing the total_tax variable, we can easily calculate the tax amount:\ntotal_tax\r6500.0\r","date":1675987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675987200,"objectID":"02bbd20a4e06092027feb27c7b31eb1a","permalink":"https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/arithmetic_python/","publishdate":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/arithmetic_python/","section":"post","summary":" Featuring an Analysis of Types of Numbers, Basic Arithmetic Procedures, the Distinction between Classic and Floor Division, and Object Allocation.","tags":["Python Basics","Airthmetic Operators","Data Science"],"title":"Numbers and airthmetic Operators in Python","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mohan Kumar Pudasaini"],"categories":["Pyhton"],"content":"Once you have installed Jupyter Notebook, you can start it by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing \u0026ldquo;jupyter notebook\u0026rdquo;.

Markdown is a simple markup language that is easily readable and provides a lightweight way to add formatting to text.here are some examples:\nHeading In Markdown, headings can be created by using the hash symbol (#) followed by a space and the text of the heading. The number of hashes used determines the level of the heading, with one hash being the largest heading (H1) and six hashes being the smallest (H6). For example\ncode:\n# Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3\r#### Heading 4\r##### Heading 5\r###### Heading 6\routput:\nHeading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis bold, italic, and strikethrough are formatting options in Markdown that can be used to add visual interest and clarity to text. here are some examples:\nCode:\n*Italic* _Italic_\r**B0ld** __Bold__\r~~Strikethrough.~~\rOutput:\nItalic Italic\nBold Bold\nStrikethrough.\nLists Lists are a great way to organize and present information in Markdown. here is some examples how we can make list in ordered and unordered way in markdown.\nUnordered list can be creat using *,+,- for example: Code:\n+ Item 1\r- Item 2\r* Item 3\rOutput:\nItem 1 Item 2 Item 3 Ordered list can be creat using numerical order: Code\n1.

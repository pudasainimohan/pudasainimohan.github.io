      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to share that my article from the WCO BACUDA Scholarship Programme has been featured in the  World Customs Organization (WCO) ROCB AP (Regional Office for Capacity Building for the Asia/Pacific) Newsletter – Issue 90
In this article, I have explained how the BACUDA Scholarship was truly instrumental in strengthening both my personal growth and professional contribution to Customs administration. The programme expanded my technical capacity in data analytics and AI, sharpened my problem-solving mindset, and empowered me to design innovative solutions that directly support evidence-based Customs operations. It also broadened my global perspective through collaboration with officers from 12 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Journey to Becoming a WCO Accredited Risk Management Expert</title>
      <link>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/2025_accreditation_journy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/2025_accreditation_journy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Achieving WCO accreditation was a dream I had since the day I first heard about it after joining Nepal Customs. In 2025, that dream finally came true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-classroom-to-customs&#34;&gt;From Classroom to Customs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My professional journey began in education. After completing Grade 12, I started teaching tuition classes and later joined a private school as a teacher. Those early years shaped my values of hard work, discipline, and dedication. Teaching also sparked my passion for facilitation, which would become a central part of my Customs career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined the Civil Service in 2014. In 2017, I started working with Nepal Customs. It was during one of my first WCO-supported national workshops that I first heard the term “WCO Accredited Expert”. As the facilitator introduced himself, I felt an instant connection to that role. It blended my passion for training with technical expertise. I vividly remember going home that evening and searching online to learn everything I could about the accreditation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vision-with-action&#34;&gt;A Vision with Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got information that one of the main eligibility criteria was minimum five years of experience in Customs. I set my sights on that goal and took action.To stay aligned with global practices, I regularly consulted the WCO website and familiarized myself with its tools, instruments, and latest developments. Alongside my regular duties, I continued facilitating internal training and workshops, activily involved various Customs modernization activies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, I was also honored with several awards including Best Teacher and Best Employee, which reinforced my motivation to keep pushing forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;awards_photo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Collage showing Best Teacher, Best Employee, and Customs Recognition Awards – WCO accredited expert and trainer from Nepal&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-road-to-accreditation&#34;&gt;The Road to Accreditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, I noticed that WCO had circulated letter for a Pre-Accreditation Workshop on Risk Management. I applied through my administration and was nominated by Nepal Customs. I was fortunate to be shortlisted among 12 candidates from the Asia-Pacific region. It was one of the happiest and proudest moments of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, I participated in the pre-accreditation workshop held in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;RM_Accreditation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Participating in WCO Pre-Accreditation Workshop on Risk Management – Customs and data analytics expert from Nepal&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop was intense and challenging. Each day involved new assignments, presentations, group exercises, and report writing. I was often sleeping only 3 to 4 hours due to the pressure to perform. But I stayed focused and succeeded in passing this stage of the accreditation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accreditation-achieved&#34;&gt;Accreditation Achieved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued building my skills and staying current with global Customs developments. Then in 2025, I received an invitation for the final mission for  accreditation. I successfully conducted the mission and officially certified as a &lt;strong&gt;WCO Accredited Technical and Operational Advisor on Risk Management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;Official Certificate of WCO Accredited Technical and Operational Advisor on Risk Management – Customs expert and facilitator&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-commitment-ahead&#34;&gt;My Commitment Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accreditation is not the end. It is the beginning of a larger responsibility. As a WCO accredited expert, I am committed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitating national and international capacity building programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting WCO members to enhance their risk management systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting the use of data analytics in Customs for trade facilitation and risk management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributing to global Customs modernization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Future of Data-Driven Vigilance in Customs</title>
      <link>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/202601-icd/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/202601-icd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;International Customs Day is celebrated each year on the 26th of January and regards the customs administrations&amp;rsquo; critical functions such as societal and economic security, trade facilitation, and economic prosperity. Every year, the World Customs Organization (WCO) puts out its International Customs Day theme to underscore the most recent challenges and opportunities regarding customs. The WCO theme for 2026 is &amp;ldquo;Customs protecting society through vigilance and commitment&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of this year’s theme and Nepal’s evolving trade environment, my op-ed was published in the national daily The Rising Nepal. The article discusses how, in a dynamic world where technology is advancing rapidly, data must be treated as a key pillar of customs vigilance. It emphasizes that advanced data analytics — including artificial intelligence and machine learning — should be a strategic priority for Customs administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By strengthening data-driven risk management, Customs can more effectively balance its dual mandate of trade facilitation and enforcement, enabling faster clearance for compliant traders while applying targeted controls where risks are identified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Second WCO Accreditation Achieved: Technical and Operational Advisor in Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/202601-da-accreditation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/202601-da-accreditation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am honored to share that I have recently been accredited by the World Customs Organization (WCO) as a Technical and Operational Advisor in the area of Data Analytics. This marks my second accreditation from the WCO, following my earlier recognition as an expert in Risk Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Clive Humby famously said, “Data is the new oil.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customs administrations around the world handle vast volumes of data every day. In the context of increasingly complex trade patterns, data analytics plays a crucial role in enhancing Customs operations — from detecting hidden risks and identifying fraud, to facilitating legitimate trade and supporting economic analysis and policy planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a WCO-accredited expert, I look forward to contributing to the global customs and trade community through capacity-building initiatives, supporting Customs administrations in harnessing the power of data analytics to modernize operations, strengthen compliance, enhance trade facilitation, and ultimately contribute to sustainable economic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;Official Certificate of WCO Accredited Technical and Operational Advisor in the area of Data Analytics – Trade, Customs expert and facilitator&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Journey to Becoming a WCO Accredited Risk Management Expert</title>
      <link>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/2025_accreditation_journy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/2025_accreditation_journy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Achieving WCO accreditation was a dream I had since the day I first heard about it after joining Nepal Customs. In 2025, that dream finally came true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-classroom-to-customs&#34;&gt;From Classroom to Customs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My professional journey began in education. After completing Grade 12, I started teaching tuition classes and later joined a private school as a teacher. Those early years shaped my values of hard work, discipline, and dedication. Teaching also sparked my passion for facilitation, which would become a central part of my Customs career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined the Civil Service in 2014. In 2017, I started working with Nepal Customs. It was during one of my first WCO-supported national workshops that I first heard the term “WCO Accredited Expert”. As the facilitator introduced himself, I felt an instant connection to that role. It blended my passion for training with technical expertise. I vividly remember going home that evening and searching online to learn everything I could about the accreditation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vision-with-action&#34;&gt;A Vision with Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got information that one of the main eligibility criteria was minimum five years of experience in Customs. I set my sights on that goal and took action.To stay aligned with global practices, I regularly consulted the WCO website and familiarized myself with its tools, instruments, and latest developments. Alongside my regular duties, I continued facilitating internal training and workshops, activily involved various Customs modernization activies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, I was also honored with several awards including Best Teacher and Best Employee, which reinforced my motivation to keep pushing forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;awards_photo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Collage showing Best Teacher, Best Employee, and Customs Recognition Awards – WCO accredited expert and trainer from Nepal&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-road-to-accreditation&#34;&gt;The Road to Accreditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, I noticed that WCO had circulated letter for a Pre-Accreditation Workshop on Risk Management. I applied through my administration and was nominated by Nepal Customs. I was fortunate to be shortlisted among 12 candidates from the Asia-Pacific region. It was one of the happiest and proudest moments of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, I participated in the pre-accreditation workshop held in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;RM_Accreditation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Participating in WCO Pre-Accreditation Workshop on Risk Management – Customs and data analytics expert from Nepal&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop was intense and challenging. Each day involved new assignments, presentations, group exercises, and report writing. I was often sleeping only 3 to 4 hours due to the pressure to perform. But I stayed focused and succeeded in passing this stage of the accreditation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accreditation-achieved&#34;&gt;Accreditation Achieved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued building my skills and staying current with global Customs developments. Then in 2025, I received an invitation for the final mission for  accreditation. I successfully conducted the mission and officially certified as a &lt;strong&gt;WCO Accredited Technical and Operational Advisor on Risk Management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;Official Certificate of WCO Accredited Technical and Operational Advisor on Risk Management – Customs expert and facilitator&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-commitment-ahead&#34;&gt;My Commitment Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accreditation is not the end. It is the beginning of a larger responsibility. As a WCO accredited expert, I am committed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitating national and international capacity building programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting WCO members to enhance their risk management systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting the use of data analytics in Customs for trade facilitation and risk management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributing to global Customs modernization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Celebrating International Customs Day with Nepal&#39;s Path to Modernization</title>
      <link>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/icd_2025/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://pudasainimohan.com.np/post/icd_2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;International Customs Day is celebrated each year on the 26th of January and regards the customs administrations&amp;rsquo; critical functions such as societal and economic security, trade facilitation, and economic prosperity. Every year, the World Customs Organization (WCO) puts out its International Customs Day theme to underscore the most recent challenges and opportunities regarding customs. The WCO theme for 2025 is &amp;ldquo;Customs Delivering on its Commitment to Efficiency, Security, and Prosperity&amp;rdquo;. This theme indicates the commitment to the development and modernization of customs processes around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nepal Customs has made notable progress in using digital tools and automation, with ASYCUDA World as the main system for declarations in major customs offices. Many modules support data-based operations, including risk-based targeting, creating risk profiles, forecasting trade and revenue, valuation, and providing trade statistics to the public. The launch of a National Single Window system has made trade easier by allowing regulatory bodies to issue licenses, permits, certificates, and other documents online. A notable development in the utilization of AI in the Nepal Customs is the application of AI driven Harmonic code search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving effective risk management and data analytics has been one of the cornerstones of improving efficiency, transparency, and compliance in customs. The building blocks of big data and artificial intelligence and machine learning enables decision-making, risk assessment, and resource allocation within the Customs to be more effective. Data driven techniques help mitigate the unidentified and managed trends, patterns, and trade compliance risks. They also facilitate the targeting and profiling of different threats on the basis of risks. These improvements augment the effectiveness of transparency and accountability in customs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after these changes took place, Nepal Customs have some challenges during the process of a fully data rich environment. The issues such as legal framework on incorporation of AI in customization of frameworks, data strategy, data quality, infrastructure and capacity building need to be resolved for the effective use of emerging technologies. The customs personnel need orientation and capacity building to achieve maximum benefit out of data analytics. It is imperative to foster an innovation culture within the organization because when the innovation change resistance is removed progress is continuously made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancing security measures is another priority for Nepal Customs in the fight against illicit trade and smuggling. With respect to these activities the non intrusive inspection, enhanced border control and especially working together with international partners will earn paramount importance. Furthermore, active stance towards crisis set up, especially environmental and cyber crisis, will build more strength and maintain the ongoing stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As global trade continues to transform, Nepal Customs is at a crucial point both for prospects and for problems. Achieving modernization is not only about utilizing new techniques, but also about enabling an entire system that can integrate innovation and economic growth while ensuring safety. Nepal’s customs operations can be transformed into a powerful engine for national economic development by purposefully putting resources into the digital infrastructure, enhancing the ability of people, and cultivating a culture of constant change. The way forward is an integrated, comprehensive, and bold approach which puts emphasis on the inclusion of technology, and at the same time preserving the systems that rely on human skill for positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global trade has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years. Merchandise trade volumes have steadily increased since 2015 and have been forecasted to grow in future years, showcasing the resilience of global trade systems. The sharp V-shaped recovery following the disruptions caused by COIVD 19 emphasizes how adaptable these systems have become, largely due to advancements in technology and data-driven decision-making.

&lt;p&gt;Modern customs authorities must adapt to the complexities of increased trade flows while ensuring efficiency, security, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-data-challenge-in-modern-customs&#34;&gt;The Data Challenge in Modern Customs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With global e-commerce surpassing $1 trillion annually and air passenger traffic recovering rapidly, customs administrations are inundated with data from multiple sources. Effectively leveraging these data streams is critical for meeting operational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-customs-data-sources&#34;&gt;Key Customs Data Sources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customs authorities process massive volumes of information generated across multiple domains, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Import and Export Declarations:&lt;/strong&gt; Containing detailed information about goods, parties involved, and declared values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo Manifests:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing logistics and carrier details critical for tracking shipments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Passenger Information (API) &amp;amp; Passenger Name Records (PNR):&lt;/strong&gt; Enabling effective risk assessment of travelers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LPCO:&lt;/strong&gt; License, Permit, Certificate, and Other Approvals,Supporting trade facilitation and regulatory compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
